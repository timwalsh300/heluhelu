My wife said she wanted an app where she could keep a list of all the 
books she owns, mark some as favorites, and then share the list with 
others so they know what she already has or what kind of books she 
likes, and let other people do the same. It seemed like a good exercise 
for me, so I built it. I originally used GoodReads API to search for and 
find books, their cover images, etc. but ported to the OpenLibrary.org 
API when GoodReads announced that they would disable their API.

Users can create an account, login, search for books, add books to their 
collection, and see other users' collections. Users can see the most 
popular books in the community on the front page. Future functionality 
might include being able to mark books as favorites, having a separate 
wishlist for each user, and adding referral links to Amazon to purchase 
books.
