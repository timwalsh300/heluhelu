My wife said she wants an app where she can keep a list of all the books 
she owns, mark some as favorites, and then share the list with others so 
they know what she already has or what kind of books she likes. It seems 
like a good exercise for me, so I'm building it. I am using the 
GoodReads API to search for and find books, their cover images, etc. A 
user will be able to create an account, logon, search for books, add 
books to their list, mark some as favorites, and see other users' lists 
or search for the most common or most favorited books in the community. 
Later, I will look at functionality for referring users to Amazon to 
purchase books.
